- I'm Cynu Mini, and this is my site. It exists to document the things I do.
- Here are some areas I'm actively working on:
	- Programming in general
	- Computer graphics
	- Japanese language
- Besides that, I'm interested in learning the basics of art. I also love watching anime, playing visual novels, and gaming.
- Right now, the site is pretty much empty except for this text.
