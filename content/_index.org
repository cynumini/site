This is my third attempt to start posting here. But this time, I will
actually do it for real! My current idea for this site is to make it
an online journal, where I will write about stuff I'm doing and what I
learned from it. Probably I will accumulate my insights, ideas, small
reviews, and progress over the week and post it here. Also, I want to
make posts about things that interest me, to use these posts as useful
information for me in the future (for example it's can be some kind of
cheat sheet). Another thing I want to try is creating something like
handmade MAL, where I decide entirely how it looks and works. Maybe I
can do something similar for games as well.
