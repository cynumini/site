- This isn't a real project, but I used it to experiment with OpenGL. I followed [The Cherno's playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) as a guide, though I donâ€™t plan to strictly stick to it.
- I originally started the project in Zig but decided to continue in C-style C++ because it feels more suited to OpenGL. I might return to Zig in the future.
