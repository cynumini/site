title: "Site"

- This site does not have a global or main idea. For now, I will add whatever I feel like. But I want to fill it with something at least for now. So I'm writing down a kind of to-do list of possible things I want to do with this site:
  - [ ] Shortcuts list (it will be a post about shortcuts in programs that I use sometime but can memorize, so this will be a quick reference for me. I will try to use default one in most of the cases)
  - [ ] My Neovim setup (here I will explain how my neovim setup works, for my future reference if I decide to rewrite it)
  - [ ] My Linux setup (like the "My Neovim setup", but for Linux)
  - [ ] "MyAnimeList" like page for anime, games, books and other staff. (maybe a script that generates this kind of page, so I don't need anilist.co anymore)
  - [ ] Read other personals sites and wikis for inspiration. Maybe make a list of the coolest ones.
