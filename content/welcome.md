This site is my little blog where I want to share things I like and work on. My current main things is programming, game development and learning Japanese, also I tied drawing in the past and want to continue in near future.

First goal of this blog is to try to establish routine of posting my progress of working on my things. Because it's help me keep motivated to do them.

Second things, besides update I want to do thing like post things about thing I did this week. I don't know how to describe it, so I'll just name the first topic I want to cover: "Setting up my Neovim config"
