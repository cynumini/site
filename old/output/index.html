<p>First goal of this blog is to try to establish routine of posting my progress of working on my things. Because it's help me keep motivated to do them.</p>
<p>Second things, besides update I want to do thing like post things about thing I did this week. I don't know how to describe it, so I'll just name the first topic I want to cover: "Setting up my Neovim config"</p>
